Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interstellar objects passing through our Solar System have been one of the
 most amazing scientific discoveries of the last decade.
 Interstellar objects originate beyond our Solar System and travel on hyperbolic
 trajectories with respect to our Sun.
 1I/'Oumuamua is a strange object that passed through our solar system in
 2017, and is believed to be the first known interstellar object to have
 entered our solar system.
 The object was discovered on October 19, 2017, by the Pan-STARRS1 telescope
 in Hawaii

.
 It was initially thought to be a comet, but later observations showed that
 it did not have the expected coma, or cloud of gas and dust, that is typically
 associated with comets.
 Instead, it was determined to be an asteroid, although it was unlike any
 asteroid that had been seen before.
 One of the most puzzling aspects of 'Oumuamua is its trajectory.
 It came from the direction of the constellation Lyra, and its high speed
 and trajectory suggest that it did not originate in our solar system.
 Instead, it is believed to have come from another star system and was just
 passing through our solar system on its way to somewhere else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another such interstellar object was 2I/Borisov.
 Borisov is a comet that was discovered in August 2019 by Gennady Borisov

.
 It is believed to be the second known interstellar object to have entered
 our solar system.
 It was first spotted by the MARGO observatory in Nauchnij, Crimea

.
 Comet Borisov made its closest approach to the Sun in December 2019 and
 was visible from Earth for several months as it passed through our solar
 system.
 It was observed to have a coma, or a cloud of gas and dust that is typical
 of comets, as well as a long, faint tail.
 Since the discovery of comet Borisov, astronomers have been closely studying
 it in order to learn more about its composition, structure, and origin.
 The study of interstellar objects like asteroid Borisov is of great interest
 to scientists, as it can provide insight into the formation and evolution
 of other star systems in our galaxy.

\begin_layout Section
Mission Interest
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studying interstellar objects passing through our solar system is important
 for several reasons.
 By studying these objects, scientists can gain insights into the processes
 that led to the formation of other solar systems and the conditions that
 existed in the early universe.
 Interstellar objects can provide clues about the composition, structure,
 and properties of other star systems in our galaxy.
 Interstellar objects may provide opportunities for future missions to explore
 and study objects outside of our own solar system.
 By studying these objects, scientists can identify potential targets for
 future missions and develop technologies and techniques for exploring the
 universe beyond our own backyard.

This report will try and determine whether a rendezvous or fly-by mission
 to such objects is feasible.

\begin_layout Section
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine that these objects were indeed interstellar, the orbital elements
 of the objects were calculated.
 Subsequently, in order to determine whether a rendezvous or fly-by mission
 to such objects is feasible, several calculations were performed using
 established methods from Curtis, 2013

.
 A Universal Variable two-body propagator was initially generated using
 Algorithms 3.3 and 3.4, followed by the use of a Lambert's solver based on
 Algorithm 5.2, to generate a range of departure and arrival dates and their
 corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$
\end_inset

 values

Looking at the above plots, rendezvous and fly-by missions to both the objects

 Considering the extra

 needed for rendezvous, the optimal mission type would be a fly-by to both
 the objects.
 As it is clear from the fly-by to 1I/'Oumuamua plot, there are a few departure
 and arrival windows (departing January-March 2017, and arriving October-Novembe

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, studying interstellar objects passing through our solar system
 is important for a variety of reasons, including expanding our knowledge
 of other star systems and their formation, understanding the early history
 of our own solar system, and potentially detecting signs of life elsewhere
 in the universe.
 Additionally, studying these objects helps us to improve our detection
 and tracking capabilities, which is essential for protecting our planet
 from potential impacts.
 This report has determined that rendezvous and fly-by missions to both
 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov is realistic and feasible.
 As more interstellar objects are discovered and studied, we can expect
 to gain even more insights into the mysteries of our universe and our place
 within it.
